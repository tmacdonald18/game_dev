This will contain Asset structuring guidelines.

>> Any Sprites should have their spritesheets (whether in progress or completed) uploaded to the Sprites folder
>> Any Objects should have their spritesheets (or individual pngs, depending on the nature of the object, uploaded to the Objects folder
>> Distinction between Sprites and Objects:
    >> Sprites are NPCs with animations and some sort of AI component to them (player, bat enemy, boss, sharksmith, etc.)
    >> Objects I will provide a definition with examples (trees, boulders, street lamps, pedastals, etc.)
